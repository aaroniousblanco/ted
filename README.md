# Ted Search

# Backend
The server file is set to run on port 3001. I use nodemon to run the backend file/s. E.g. 'nodemon index.js' from the backend folder.

# Frontend
I used create-react-app, so it's a simple 'npm start' from the frontend folder.

# Things I wish I had time to complete
- code cleanup, refactoring, removing some of the boilerplate bloat, etc.
- improve the quality/maintainability of the imageUrl fetching from the Moviedb
- autocomplete dropdown functionality for searching
- filtering on genres, release year ranges, etc.
- general styling improvements (this was my first time using Material-UI, so there was a learning curve involved) 
- fixing the issue with lower rows of 'cards' being pushed down when there are more than just a handful of search results and a    card in an upper row is expanded
- And more...
